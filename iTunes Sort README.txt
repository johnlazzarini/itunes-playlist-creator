Add all three files to your project, and run!  You can tinker around with the itunes_file in order to
experiment with different values and results.  The header file and itunes_file were provided to me,
as well as some of the code in the .cpp file.  However, I'm responsible for the design and development of 
all of the heavy lifting that this application performs in order to yield the intended result.  

I've documented the .cpp file to indicate the sections of code that I wrote myself.  The algorithm used
to accomplish the results of this program is a brute-force solution to the subset-sum problem.
